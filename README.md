Face Detection System

A real-time face detection system that accurately identifies and localizes human faces in images and video streams. The project leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques — ranging from traditional models like Haar Cascades and HOG + SVM, to deep learning-based methods such as MTCNN or SSD — for robust and precise face detection.

This system is designed to perform reliably under variations in lighting, orientation, scale, and facial expressions, making it suitable for real-world applications in:

🔐 Security & Surveillance

🪪 Biometric Authentication

🤝 Human-Computer Interaction

🚀 Key Features

🎥 Real-time Detection: Process webcam or video feed instantly

👥 Multi-face Detection: Identify multiple faces in a single frame

💡 Robust Performance: Handles scale, lighting, and pose variations

🔮 Extendable: Can be expanded to face recognition or emotion detection

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Frameworks:

OpenCV – Image processing & classical CV methods

TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch – Deep learning-based detection

Dlib (optional) – Advanced face detection utilities
