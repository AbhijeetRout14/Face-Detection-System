Face Detection System

A real-time face detection system that accurately identifies and localizes human faces in images and video streams. The project leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques — ranging from traditional models like Haar Cascades and HOG + SVM, to deep learning-based methods such as MTCNN or SSD — for robust and precise face detection.

This system is designed to perform reliably under variations in lighting, orientation, scale, and facial expressions, making it suitable for real-world applications in:

🔐 Security & Surveillance

🪪 Biometric Authentication

🤝 Human-Computer Interaction

🚀 Key Features
